  dialogue:
  - 'Our client has an expectation for how they want their buildings designed. '
  - Because of this, we are provided a set of shapes for each floor in the form of
    tilesets.
  - Each tile costs money to place. Generally the larger the tile, the more it will
    cost.
  - See those yellow bits? They are called 'overhangs'. Ill get to those later.
