  dialogue:
  - When you begin work on the next floor, you will see a shadow that outlines your
    previous floor.
  - Building on top of a previous foundation is much cheaper than building overhangs.
  - The exception to this is a golden tile. They can be placed outside the shaded
    area for cheap.
  - Keep all of your tiles (exclusing the gold onces) inside the shaded area to score
    a perfect floor!
