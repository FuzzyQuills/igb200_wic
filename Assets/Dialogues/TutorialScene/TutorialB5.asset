  - When you start, you will see a bunch of boxes. Open them up and they will provide
    you with pipes.
  - What? Did you expect your pipes to be unpacked? Well we'll give you some of those
    too.
  - You can rotate these pipes by tappin' them. Getting them alligned properly makes
    them green.
  - Once you've connected the pipe on the top left, to the bottom right pipe, you
    win!
  - Get this done quick and you will be rewarded handsomely.
