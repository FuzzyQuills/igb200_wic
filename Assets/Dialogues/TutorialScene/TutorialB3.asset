  dialogue:
  - 'Well since they''ll be working with me i feel more obliged to show them and
    a little safer if told them how everything works around here. '
  - Our job around here is to satisfy our clients needs by getting the "nodes" for
    each floor working as intended.
  - The quality of your work will dictate how much funding the client grants you
    for your future floors, so it's important to do a good job.
  - I will warn you though, as the tower increases in size, the expectations of the
    client will increase.
  - 'The general rule of thumb is that the quicker you can get your work done, the
    better you will be rewarded. '
