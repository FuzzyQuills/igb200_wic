  dialogue:
  - Right well I wont take much of your time. I just want to go over the most important
    part of floor development - presentation!
  - The objective of the project is to make as large a lower as possible, yes, but
    did you know about perfect floors?
  - A 'perfect floor' is made when you perfect a blueprint (all tiles are within
    a shaded area), and you score 5 stars on all construction projects.
  - That's all I have to discuss. I hope you see you again soon!
