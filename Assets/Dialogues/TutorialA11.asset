  dialogue:
  - When you begin work on the next floor, you will see a shadow that outlines your
    previous floor.
  - Building on top of a previous foundation is much cheaper than creating overhanging
    areas.
  - The exception to this is those golden tiles from earlier. They are designed in
    a way that makes them cheaper to place this way.
  - If you do manage to keep your floor in the bounds of the previous floor, then
    that's pretty cool! We call these 'perfect floors'.
