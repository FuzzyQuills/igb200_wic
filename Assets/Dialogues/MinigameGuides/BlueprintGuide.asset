  dialogue:
  - You can drag and drop as many tiles as you wish on the blueprint.
  - You have to place all of the interior nodes in order to proceed.
  - Interior nodes represent the construction you will do afterwards. Place them
    in areas with a lot of room for more rewards later.
  - Placing tiles outside of the shaded area increases their price. Plan accordingly!
  - Golden tiles can be placed outside shaded areas for cheaper. This is a good way
    to expand your work area next floor.
  - Don't worry if you run out of money. You still have time to make it back in the
    construction phase.
