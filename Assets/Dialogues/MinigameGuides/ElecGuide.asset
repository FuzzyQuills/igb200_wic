  dialogue:
  - In this minigame, you want to balance the total voltage feed to the building!
    (1 of 7)
  - On the bottom you have your output voltage and your desired voltage. (2 of 7)
  - At the top is your starting voltage. The switches add to this starting voltage.
    (3 of 7)
  - The tolerance value tells you how much lower and higher your total output voltage
    can be from the desired voltage to win. (4 of 7)
  - The goal is to get as close to the desired output voltage as possible. (5 of
    7)
  - At least one switch in each row has to be switched on to make a connection to
    the next layer. (6 of 7)
  - Once all layers are on, throwing the final switch will reveal your output voltage!
    (7 of 7)
